## Starting and Managing Timer Sessions

### Starting a Timer

There are several ways to start timing your work:

#### From a Task Card

1. **Click on any task** to open the task details modal
2. **Click the "Start Timer" button** (▶️ play icon)
3. The timer immediately begins and appears in the header
4. The task is automatically marked as "In Progress"

#### From the Header Timer

1. **Click the timer display** in the header
2. **Select a task** from the dropdown
3. **Click "Start"** to begin timing

#### Using the AI Assistant

Simply say: "Start a timer for [task name]" or "Start timing my current task"

### Timer Interface

When a timer is active, you'll see:

- **Elapsed time**: Real-time display in MM:SS format
- **Task name**: Which task you're timing
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily stop the timer
- **Stop**: End the session and add notes

### Managing Active Sessions

#### Pausing and Resuming

- **Click the pause button** (⏸️) to temporarily stop timing
- **Click resume** (▶️) to continue from where you left off
- **Pause reasons**: Meetings, breaks, interruptions, lunch

#### Taking Breaks

KiraPilot automatically tracks break time:

1. **Click "Take Break"** when pausing
2. **Select break type**:
   - Coffee break (5-15 minutes)
   - Lunch break (30-60 minutes)
   - Meeting (varies)
   - Personal (varies)
3. **Resume when ready** - break time is tracked separately

#### Switching Tasks

- **Stop current timer** and add session notes
- **Start new timer** for the different task
- Or use **"Switch Task"** to seamlessly transition

### Stopping Timer Sessions

When you finish working:

1. **Click "Stop Timer"** in the header or task modal
2. **Add session notes** (optional but recommended):
   - What you accomplished
   - Any blockers encountered
   - Next steps or reminders
   - Quality of focus (1-5 stars)
3. **Click "Save Session"**

The session is automatically saved with:

- Start and end times
- Total duration
- Break time (if any)
- Associated task
- Your notes and focus rating

## Session Notes and Documentation

### Why Add Session Notes?

Session notes help you:

- **Remember context** when returning to tasks
- **Track progress** on complex projects
- **Identify blockers** and patterns
- **Improve estimates** for similar future work
- **Provide status updates** to team members

### Effective Session Notes

**Good Examples:**

```
✅ "Completed user authentication flow. Fixed login validation bug.
   Next: implement password reset feature."

✅ "Researched 3 design patterns for data caching. Decided on
   Redis approach. Need to discuss with team before implementing."

✅ "Wrote first draft of quarterly report. Still need Q3 sales
   figures from Sarah. Focus was good - no interruptions."
```

**Less Helpful:**

```
❌ "Worked on stuff"
❌ "Made progress"
❌ "Did some coding"
```

### Session Note Templates

Create templates for different types of work:

**Development Work:**

```
**Completed:**
- [List what you finished]

**In Progress:**
- [What you're currently working on]

**Blockers:**
- [Any issues or dependencies]

**Next Session:**
- [What to tackle next]
```

**Research/Learning:**

```
**Key Findings:**
- [Important discoveries]

**Resources:**
- [Useful links or references]

**Questions:**
- [Things to investigate further]

**Application:**
- [How to use this knowledge]
```
