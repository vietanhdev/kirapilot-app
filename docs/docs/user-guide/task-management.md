2. **Enter a descriptive title** - be specific about what needs to be done
3. **Add details** using the rich text editor (optional)
4. **Set priority level** based on urgency and importance
5. **Estimate time** to help with planning
6. **Add tags** for categorization
7. **Click "Create Task"**

### Task Creation Best Practices

**Good Task Titles:**

- ‚úÖ "Review Q3 marketing campaign performance"
- ‚úÖ "Update customer database with new contact info"
- ‚úÖ "Prepare presentation for Monday's team meeting"

**Avoid Vague Titles:**

- ‚ùå "Marketing stuff"
- ‚ùå "Database work"
- ‚ùå "Meeting prep"

### Quick Task Creation

For rapid task entry:

- **Use the AI Assistant**: Say "Create a task to..." and let AI handle the details
- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Ctrl/Cmd + N` to open the new task dialog
- **Drag and drop**: Create tasks directly in specific day columns

## Task Properties

### Priority Levels

KiraPilot uses a four-level priority system:

#### üî¥ Urgent (Priority 3)

- **When to use**: Critical issues, emergencies, hard deadlines today
- **Examples**: System outages, client emergencies, same-day deadlines
- **Visual**: Red indicator, appears at top of lists

#### üü° High (Priority 2)

- **When to use**: Important tasks with near-term deadlines
- **Examples**: Weekly reports, important meetings, project milestones
- **Visual**: Yellow indicator, high visibility

#### üîµ Medium (Priority 1) - Default

- **When to use**: Regular work tasks, routine activities
- **Examples**: Email responses, documentation, regular maintenance
- **Visual**: Blue indicator, standard positioning

#### ‚ö™ Low (Priority 0)

- **When to use**: Nice-to-have tasks, learning, optimization
- **Examples**: Reading articles, organizing files, exploring new tools
- **Visual**: Gray indicator, appears lower in lists

### Time Estimates

Accurate time estimates improve planning and productivity insights:

- **Start conservative**: It's better to overestimate initially
- **Use historical data**: Check similar completed tasks for reference
- **Break down large tasks**: Split tasks over 2 hours into smaller pieces
- **Account for interruptions**: Add 20-30% buffer for unexpected delays

**Time Estimate Guidelines:**

- **15-30 minutes**: Quick tasks, email responses, brief calls
- **30-60 minutes**: Focused work sessions, document reviews
- **1-2 hours**: Deep work, complex problem-solving
- **2+ hours**: Consider breaking into subtasks

### Tags and Categories

Tags help organize and filter tasks across different dimensions:

**Common Tag Categories:**

- **Context**: `@office`, `@home`, `@computer`, `@phone`
- **Project**: `project-alpha`, `website-redesign`, `q4-planning`
- **Type**: `meeting`, `research`, `writing`, `coding`
- **Energy**: `high-energy`, `low-energy`, `creative`, `administrative`

**Tag Best Practices:**

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep tags short and memorable
- Don't over-tag (3-5 tags maximum per task)
- Review and clean up unused tags regularly

## Rich Text Descriptions

KiraPilot includes a powerful rich text editor for detailed task descriptions:

### Formatting Options

- **Bold text**: `**important points**` or Ctrl/Cmd + B
- **Italic text**: `*emphasis*` or Ctrl/Cmd + I
- **Lists**: Bulleted and numbered lists
- **Links**: Add URLs for reference materials
- **Code blocks**: For technical tasks with code snippets

### Description Best Practices

**Include:**

- **Acceptance criteria**: What defines "done"
- **Resources**: Links to relevant documents or tools
- **Context**: Why this task is important
- **Notes**: Any special considerations or constraints

**Example Good Description:**

```
Review and update the customer onboarding process documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All steps are current and accurate
- Screenshots reflect the latest UI
- New team members can follow without assistance

**Resources:**
- Current documentation: [link]

- Consider mobile experience
```

## Task Organization

### Task Lists

Organize tasks into separate lists for different contexts:

#### Creating Task Lists

1. Click the **task list dropdown** in the header
2. Select **"Manage Lists"**
3. Click **"Create New List"**
4. Enter name and description
5. Choose a color theme (optional)

#### Common List Structures

**By Context:**

- Personal
- Work - Project A
- Work - Project B
- Learning & Development

**By Role:**

- Manager Tasks
- Individual Contributor
- Team Collaboration
- Administrative

**By Time Horizon:**

- This Week
- This Month
- This Quarter
- Someday/Maybe

### Task Scheduling

#### The Weekly Planning Approach

KiraPilot's weekly view is designed for effective planning:

1. **Sunday Planning**: Review the upcoming week
2. **Daily Scheduling**: Drag tasks to specific days
3. **Capacity Management**: Don't overload any single day
4. **Buffer Time**: Leave 20-30% of your day unscheduled

#### Scheduling Strategies

**Time-Based Scheduling:**

- Schedule high-priority tasks during your peak energy hours
- Group similar tasks together (batch processing)
- Leave buffer time between meetings

**Energy-Based Scheduling:**

- **High-energy tasks**: Complex problem-solving, creative work
- **Medium-energy tasks**: Meetings, collaboration, routine work
- **Low-energy tasks**: Email, filing, administrative work

**Context-Based Scheduling:**

- Group tasks by location (`@office`, `@home`)
- Batch tasks requiring similar tools or resources
- Consider transition time between different types of work

## Task Status Management

### Status Workflow

Tasks progress through these states:

1. **Pending** (Default): Task is created but not started
2. **In Progress**: Actively working on the task
3. **Completed**: Task is finished
4. **Cancelled**: Task is no longer needed

### Status Best Practices

- **Update status regularly**: Keep your task board current
- **Use "In Progress" sparingly**: Limit to 2-3 active tasks
- **Complete tasks promptly**: Don't let completed tasks linger
- **Review cancelled tasks**: Learn from changed priorities

## Advanced Task Features

### Task Dependencies

While KiraPilot doesn't currently support formal task dependencies, you can manage them effectively:

**In Task Descriptions:**

```
**Depends on:**
- [ ] Task A must be completed first
- [ ] Waiting for approval from John
- [ ] Need data from Q3 report

**Blocks:**
- Task X (waiting for this to finish)
- Team meeting agenda (needs this input)
```

**Using Tags:**

- `blocked`: Task cannot proceed
- `waiting-for`: Waiting on external input
- `prerequisite`: Must be done before other tasks

### Recurring Tasks

For tasks that repeat regularly:

1. **Create a template task** with detailed description
2. **Use consistent naming**: "Weekly Report - [Date]"
3. **Set up reminders** using the AI assistant
4. **Clone completed tasks** for the next iteration

### Task Templates

Create templates for common task types:

**Meeting Preparation Template:**

```
**Agenda Items:**
- [ ] Review previous meeting notes
- [ ] Prepare status updates
- [ ] List discussion topics
- [ ] Gather supporting materials

**Follow-up:**
- [ ] Send meeting notes
- [ ] Update project status
- [ ] Schedule follow-up actions
```

## Productivity Techniques

### Getting Things Done (GTD)

KiraPilot supports GTD methodology:

1. **Capture**: Use quick task creation for all ideas
2. **Clarify**: Add detailed descriptions and context
3. **Organize**: Use task lists and tags for categories
4. **Reflect**: Weekly review using the Reports view
5. **Engage**: Use daily planning to choose next actions

### Time Blocking

Combine task management with time tracking:

1. **Estimate task duration** accurately
2. **Schedule tasks** in specific time blocks
3. **Start timers** when beginning work
4. **Track actual time** vs. estimates
5. **Adjust future estimates** based on data

### Eisenhower Matrix

Use priority levels to implement the Eisenhower Matrix:

- **Urgent + Important**: High priority, schedule immediately
- **Important + Not Urgent**: Medium priority, schedule this week
- **Urgent + Not Important**: Consider delegating or automating
- **Not Urgent + Not Important**: Low priority or eliminate

## Task Analytics and Insights

### Completion Tracking

Monitor your task completion patterns:

- **Daily completion rate**: How many tasks you finish per day
- **Time accuracy**: How close your estimates are to actual time
- **Priority distribution**: Balance of urgent vs. important work
- **Tag analysis**: Which types of tasks take longest

### Using the AI Assistant for Task Insights

Ask your AI assistant questions like:

- "What tasks am I consistently underestimating?"
- "Show me my most productive days this month"
- "Which tags are associated with my longest tasks?"
- "Help me prioritize tomorrow's tasks"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Task Overload

**Problem**: Too many tasks, feeling overwhelmed
**Solutions:**

- Use the "Someday/Maybe" list for non-urgent items
- Set daily task limits (5-7 tasks maximum)
