## AI Use Cases and Examples

### Task Creation and Management
```
User: "I need to prepare the quarterly report by next Friday and gather input from the marketing team by Wednesday"

Kira AI: "I've created two tasks for you:
1. 'Gather input from marketing team' due this Wednesday at 5pm
2. 'Prepare quarterly report' due next Friday at 5pm

I've also added a dependency so the report task will be flagged if you don't complete the marketing input task first. Should I schedule time blocks for these on your calendar?"
```

### Focus Session Management
```
User: "I want to focus on the presentation draft for 45 minutes"

Kira AI: "Starting a 45-minute focus session for 'Create presentation draft'. 
[TIMER VISUALIZATION]

I'll block notifications during this time. Based on your past focus patterns, you typically take a short break after 25 minutes. Would you like me to remind you when you reach that point?"
```

### Productivity Insights
```
User: "When am I most productive during the week?"

Kira AI: "Based on your completed tasks over the past month, you're most productive on:
1. Tuesday mornings (9-11am): 87% task completion rate
2. Thursday afternoons (2-4pm): 82% task completion rate

[PRODUCTIVITY CHART]

Your energy levels tend to dip after lunch (1-2pm) each day. Would you like me to schedule your deep work tasks during your peak productivity times?"
```

### Proactive Suggestions
```
[AI initiates conversation at 9:15am]

Kira AI: "Good morning! I notice you have 3 high-priority tasks today, including the client proposal due at 3pm. Based on your calendar, you have a 2-hour meeting block from 11am-1pm.

Would you like to start working on the proposal now? You historically complete similar tasks in about 90 minutes, and your focus score is typically highest in the morning."
```
