# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive refactoring of KiraPilot's AI architecture to move all LLM processing from the frontend to the Rust backend, implement a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) flow, and redesign tools for minimal, user-friendly interactions. The refactor aims to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience while maintaining detailed logging of all AI interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend AI Processing Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all LLM processing to happen in the Rust backend, so that the frontend remains lightweight and the AI logic is centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs AI assistance THEN the system SHALL send requests to Rust backend endpoints
2. WHEN the backend receives AI requests THEN the system SHALL process them using local LLM or external APIs
3. WHEN AI processing is complete THEN the backend SHALL return structured responses to the frontend
4. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN switching between local and external LLMs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent API interfaces

### Requirement 2: ReAct Flow Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to reason through problems and take actions systematically, so that I get more reliable and thoughtful assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI receives a user request THEN the system SHALL implement a Thought-Action-Observation cycle
2. WHEN reasoning about a task THEN the AI SHALL generate explicit thoughts before taking actions
3. WHEN taking actions THEN the system SHALL execute tools and observe results before proceeding
4. WHEN multiple steps are needed THEN the AI SHALL iterate through the ReAct cycle until completion
5. WHEN the reasoning process fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error explanations

### Requirement 3: Gemini API Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Gemini AI through the backend, so that API keys and external communications are handled securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Gemini AI THEN the backend SHALL make direct API calls to Google's services
2. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL store them securely in the backend
3. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN switching between AI providers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent interfaces
5. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4: Minimal Tool Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI tools to work seamlessly without requiring me to provide technical details like task IDs, so that interactions feel natural and effortless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask the AI to work with tasks THEN the system SHALL automatically identify relevant tasks without asking for IDs
2. WHEN multiple tasks match my request THEN the AI SHALL present options in user-friendly language
3. WHEN creating new tasks THEN the system SHALL infer context from my request without requiring structured input
4. WHEN I reference "current task" or "today's work" THEN the AI SHALL understand contextual references
5. WHEN tool execution requires parameters THEN the system SHALL derive them intelligently from context

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive AI Interaction Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want detailed logs of all AI interactions including prompts and responses, so that I can debug issues and understand AI behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AI interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL log the complete request and response
2. WHEN prompts are sent to LLMs THEN the system SHALL record the exact prompt text and parameters
3. WHEN tools are executed THEN the system SHALL log tool calls, parameters, and results
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error context and stack traces
5. WHEN users request it THEN the system SHALL provide access to interaction logs through the UI

### Requirement 6: Local LLM Support and Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test and use local LLMs for privacy and offline functionality, so that I'm not dependent on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local LLMs are available THEN the system SHALL detect and configure them automatically
2. WHEN using local models THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and status information
3. WHEN local models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to configured alternatives
4. WHEN testing AI functionality THEN the system SHALL work consistently across local and remote models
5. WHEN resource constraints exist THEN the system SHALL optimize local model usage for available hardware

### Requirement 7: LEAN Development Approach

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to follow LEAN principles, so that we deliver value incrementally and avoid over-engineering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL prioritize minimal viable implementations
2. WHEN adding complexity THEN the development SHALL justify each addition with clear user value
3. WHEN refactoring existing code THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
4. WHEN testing new features THEN the development SHALL use rapid prototyping and user feedback
5. WHEN architectural decisions are made THEN the system SHALL favor simplicity over premature optimization

### Requirement 8: Frontend-Backend Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless AI interactions regardless of the underlying architecture changes, so that my workflow remains uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends AI requests THEN the communication SHALL use type-safe interfaces
2. WHEN backend processing takes time THEN the frontend SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient communication channels
4. WHEN errors occur in communication THEN the system SHALL provide clear user feedback
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN the communication SHALL remain responsive and reliable
