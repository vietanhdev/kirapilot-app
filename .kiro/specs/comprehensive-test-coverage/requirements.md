# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement comprehensive test coverage for the KiraPilot application to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability. The current test coverage is sparse with only a few test files covering AI services, hooks, and settings components. We need to systematically add tests for all critical components, services, hooks, and utilities to achieve robust test coverage across the entire application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all React components, so that I can ensure UI components render correctly and handle user interactions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any React component is modified THEN the test suite SHALL verify the component renders without errors
2. WHEN user interactions occur on components THEN the test suite SHALL verify the correct event handlers are called
3. WHEN component props change THEN the test suite SHALL verify the component updates appropriately
4. WHEN components use context or hooks THEN the test suite SHALL verify the integration works correctly
5. IF a component has conditional rendering THEN the test suite SHALL verify all rendering paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for all custom React hooks, so that I can ensure hooks manage state correctly and handle side effects properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hooks are called THEN the test suite SHALL verify they return the expected initial state
2. WHEN hook actions are triggered THEN the test suite SHALL verify state updates correctly
3. WHEN hooks have dependencies THEN the test suite SHALL verify they respond to dependency changes
4. WHEN hooks perform side effects THEN the test suite SHALL verify the effects execute correctly
5. IF hooks handle errors THEN the test suite SHALL verify error handling works properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for all service layer components, so that I can ensure business logic executes correctly and data operations are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods are called THEN the test suite SHALL verify they return expected results
2. WHEN services interact with external dependencies THEN the test suite SHALL verify the interactions through mocks
3. WHEN services handle errors THEN the test suite SHALL verify error handling and recovery
4. WHEN services perform data transformations THEN the test suite SHALL verify the transformations are correct
5. IF services have async operations THEN the test suite SHALL verify async behavior works correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for all utility functions, so that I can ensure pure functions produce correct outputs for all input scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions receive valid inputs THEN the test suite SHALL verify they return correct outputs
2. WHEN utility functions receive edge case inputs THEN the test suite SHALL verify they handle them appropriately
3. WHEN utility functions receive invalid inputs THEN the test suite SHALL verify they handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN utility functions perform calculations THEN the test suite SHALL verify mathematical accuracy
5. IF utility functions have multiple code paths THEN the test suite SHALL verify all paths are tested

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for critical user workflows, so that I can ensure the application works correctly end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform task management operations THEN the test suite SHALL verify the complete workflow works
2. WHEN users interact with the timer system THEN the test suite SHALL verify timing functionality works correctly
3. WHEN users use AI features THEN the test suite SHALL verify AI integration works properly
4. WHEN users navigate between different sections THEN the test suite SHALL verify navigation works correctly
5. IF users perform data operations THEN the test suite SHALL verify data persistence and retrieval

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage reporting and quality metrics, so that I can monitor and maintain high code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the test suite SHALL generate coverage reports showing line, branch, and function coverage
2. WHEN coverage falls below thresholds THEN the test suite SHALL fail the build
3. WHEN new code is added THEN the test suite SHALL require tests for the new code
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the test suite SHALL provide clear feedback on test results and failures
5. IF performance regressions occur THEN the test suite SHALL detect and report them

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock implementations for external dependencies, so that I can test components in isolation without relying on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need database interactions THEN the test suite SHALL use mock database implementations
2. WHEN tests need AI service interactions THEN the test suite SHALL use mock AI service implementations
3. WHEN tests need file system operations THEN the test suite SHALL use mock file system implementations
4. WHEN tests need timer functionality THEN the test suite SHALL use mock timer implementations
5. IF tests need external API calls THEN the test suite SHALL use mock API implementations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution in the development workflow, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the test suite SHALL run automatically via git hooks
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the test suite SHALL run and report results
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the development workflow SHALL prevent code from being merged
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the development workflow SHALL allow code progression
5. IF test execution is slow THEN the test suite SHALL provide options for faster feedback loops
