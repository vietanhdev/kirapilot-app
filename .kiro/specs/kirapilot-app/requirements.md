# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KiraPilot is a desktop productivity application that combines task management, time tracking, and an intelligent AI assistant named Kira. The application aims to help users take control of their time and tasks through a beautifully designed, native-feeling interface with local data storage for privacy and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a centralized planning interface that shows weekly/daily task organization, so that I can quickly understand my current productivity state and upcoming commitments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a planning interface with weekly/daily planner as the main view
2. WHEN the user accesses planning THEN the system SHALL provide a drag-and-drop interface for task scheduling
3. WHEN tasks are organized in planning views THEN the system SHALL categorize tasks as follows:
   - **Backlog**: Tasks without a scheduled date (scheduledDate = null)
   - **Day Columns**: Tasks scheduled for specific dates (scheduledDate = specific date)
   - **Upcoming**: Tasks scheduled beyond the current view period

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage tasks with rich descriptions, priorities, and dependencies, so that I can organize my work effectively and understand task relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a task THEN the system SHALL provide a rich text editor for detailed task descriptions
2. WHEN the user sets task priorities THEN the system SHALL provide priority flags with intelligent sorting capabilities
3. WHEN the user defines task relationships THEN the system SHALL support task dependencies and display them visually
4. WHEN the user plans tasks THEN the system SHALL provide a week-based planning interface with visual timeline
5. WHEN tasks have dependencies THEN the system SHALL flag dependent tasks if prerequisites are not completed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track time spent on tasks with built-in timers and visualizations, so that I can understand my time allocation and improve my productivity patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a task THEN the system SHALL provide a built-in timer with start, pause, and reset functionality
2. WHEN time tracking is active THEN the system SHALL allow users to add session notes for context capturing
3. WHEN the user completes time tracking sessions THEN the system SHALL generate charts and visualizations of time data
4. WHEN the user views time data THEN the system SHALL display time allocation across different tasks and projects
5. WHEN the user reviews time history THEN the system SHALL provide session details and productivity insights

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with Kira AI assistant through natural language to control the app and receive intelligent suggestions, so that I can manage my productivity more efficiently and intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user communicates with Kira THEN the system SHALL provide a natural language interface using ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern for intelligent decision-making
2. WHEN Kira processes requests THEN the AI SHALL autonomously choose appropriate tools from the available tool set based on LLM reasoning rather than rule-based logic
3. WHEN the user needs assistance THEN Kira SHALL use ReAct reasoning to analyze context and determine the best sequence of tool executions to fulfill the request
4. WHEN Kira executes actions THEN the system SHALL allow the LLM to dynamically decide which tools to use, in what order, and with what parameters based on the conversation context
5. WHEN the user asks questions THEN Kira SHALL provide transparent reasoning explanations showing how it chose specific tools and actions to address the request
6. WHEN appropriate THEN Kira SHALL send helpful notifications and reminders without being intrusive, using LLM-driven decision making for timing and content
7. WHEN Kira provides responses THEN the system SHALL render markdown formatting including headers, lists, code blocks, and links for enhanced readability
8. WHEN code snippets are included in responses THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and copy-to-clipboard functionality
9. WHEN conversations become lengthy THEN the system SHALL provide collapsible sections and smooth scrolling with user control over auto-scroll behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work consistently on desktop platforms, so that I can access my productivity tools with native performance and feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the app on different desktop platforms THEN the system SHALL provide consistent experience across macOS, Windows, and Linux
2. WHEN the app runs on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL use responsive design that adapts to available screen space
3. WHEN the user interacts with the app THEN it SHALL feel native on each platform while maintaining design cohesion
4. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL load quickly with local data storage for optimal performance
5. WHEN the user works offline THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality without internet connectivity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data to remain private and secure, so that I can trust the application with my sensitive productivity information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes sensitive information THEN it SHALL use local processing and storage by default
2. WHEN AI operations occur THEN the system SHALL provide transparent explanations for suggestions and decisions
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL keep all information locally on the user's device
4. WHEN the user configures privacy settings THEN the system SHALL respect those preferences across all features
5. WHEN the system makes AI requests THEN it SHALL not share personal task or time data with external services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use SeaORM for database operations, so that I can have type-safe, async database interactions with better maintainability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs database operations THEN it SHALL use SeaORM as the primary ORM for all database interactions
2. WHEN database entities are defined THEN they SHALL be implemented as SeaORM entities with proper relationships and constraints
3. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL be managed through SeaORM's migration system
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be type-safe and use SeaORM's query builder for complex operations
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically run pending migrations through SeaORM's migration runner
6. WHEN database connections are managed THEN they SHALL use SeaORM's connection pooling for optimal performance
