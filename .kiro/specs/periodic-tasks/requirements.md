    # Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the ability to create recurring tasks that automatically generate new instances based on configurable schedules (daily, weekly, biweekly, every 3 weeks, monthly, etc.). This will help users maintain consistent habits and routines without manually recreating repetitive tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create periodic tasks with flexible scheduling options, so that I can automate recurring responsibilities and maintain consistent habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL provide an option to make it periodic
2. WHEN a user selects periodic task option THEN the system SHALL display scheduling configuration options
3. WHEN configuring a periodic task THEN the system SHALL support daily, weekly, biweekly, every 3 weeks, and monthly intervals
4. WHEN configuring a periodic task THEN the system SHALL allow custom interval specification (e.g., every N days/weeks/months)
5. WHEN a periodic task is created THEN the system SHALL store the recurrence pattern and next generation date

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want periodic tasks to automatically generate new instances at the appropriate times, so that I don't have to manually recreate recurring tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for periodic tasks that need new instances generated
2. WHEN a periodic task's next generation date is reached or passed THEN the system SHALL create a new task instance
3. WHEN generating a new task instance THEN the system SHALL copy the title, description, priority, and other properties from the template
4. WHEN generating a new task instance THEN the system SHALL calculate and set the next generation date
5. WHEN generating multiple overdue instances THEN the system SHALL create all missed instances up to the current date

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage and modify periodic task templates, so that I can update recurring patterns or stop automatic generation when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a periodic task template THEN the system SHALL display its recurrence pattern and next generation date
2. WHEN editing a periodic task template THEN the system SHALL allow modification of the recurrence pattern
3. WHEN editing a periodic task template THEN the system SHALL allow pausing or resuming automatic generation
4. WHEN deleting a periodic task template THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation and explain the impact on future instances
5. WHEN a periodic task template is deleted THEN the system SHALL stop generating new instances but preserve existing ones

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to distinguish between periodic task templates and their generated instances, so that I can understand the relationship and manage them appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the task list THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish periodic task templates from regular tasks
2. WHEN viewing a generated task instance THEN the system SHALL indicate its relationship to the parent periodic task
3. WHEN completing a generated task instance THEN the system SHALL NOT affect the periodic task template or future generations
4. WHEN viewing periodic task templates THEN the system SHALL show the count of generated instances
5. WHEN filtering tasks THEN the system SHALL provide options to show/hide periodic templates and generated instances

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want periodic tasks to integrate seamlessly with existing task management features, so that they work consistently with my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a periodic task THEN the system SHALL support all existing task properties (priority, tags, rich text description)
2. WHEN generated task instances are created THEN the system SHALL support time tracking like regular tasks
3. WHEN using AI assistant THEN the system SHALL understand and help manage periodic tasks
4. WHEN exporting or backing up data THEN the system SHALL include periodic task templates and their configuration
5. WHEN using task dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle relationships between periodic tasks and regular tasks appropriately
