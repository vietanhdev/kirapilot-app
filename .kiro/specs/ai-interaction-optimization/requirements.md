## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the AI interaction experience in KiraPilot to create more natural, contextual, and useful agent interactions. The goal is to enhance the data flow between the user and AI assistant, making the experience feel more intuitive and productive while maintaining the app's privacy-first philosophy.

## Requirements

4. WHEN I switch between different work contexts THEN the AI SHALL adapt its assistance style and suggestions accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand my work patterns and preferences, so that it can proactively suggest optimizations and improvements to my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI analyzes my work patterns THEN it SHALL identify recurring tasks, peak productivity times, and common workflow bottlenecks
2. WHEN I complete similar tasks repeatedly THEN the AI SHALL suggest automation opportunities or template creation
3. WHEN my productivity metrics indicate inefficiencies THEN the AI SHALL proactively offer relevant suggestions
4. IF I consistently work in certain patterns THEN the AI SHALL adapt its default suggestions to match my preferences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want more natural and conversational AI interactions, so that getting help feels less like using a tool and more like collaborating with an intelligent assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask the AI to create, modify, or analyze tasks THEN it SHALL have full access to the task management system
2. WHEN I request time tracking operations THEN the AI SHALL be able to start, stop, and analyze timer sessions
3. WHEN I need productivity insights THEN the AI SHALL access and analyze my historical data to provide meaningful reports
4. WHEN I ask for scheduling help THEN the AI SHALL integrate with my task planning and calendar data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want AI interactions to respect my data privacy while still being helpful, so that I can trust the system with my personal productivity data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI processes my data THEN it SHALL only access information necessary for the current interaction
2. WHEN I interact with the AI THEN all processing SHALL happen locally without sending personal data to external services
3. WHEN the AI learns from my patterns THEN it SHALL store insights locally and allow me to review or delete them
4. IF I choose to disable certain data access THEN the AI SHALL gracefully adapt its functionality while respecting my privacy preferences

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to provide actionable and contextually relevant suggestions, so that I can improve my productivity without being overwhelmed by generic advice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI makes suggestions THEN they SHALL be specific to my current situation and work patterns

3. WHEN the AI recommends changes THEN it SHALL explain the reasoning and expected benefits
4. WHEN I implement AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL track their effectiveness and adjust future recommendations accordingly
