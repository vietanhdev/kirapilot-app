# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring KiraPilot's internationalization (i18n) system to ensure comprehensive language support across the entire application. Currently, the app has a basic i18n system with English, Spanish, French, and German translations, but many UI components, AI interactions, and other parts of the application still contain hardcoded text strings. This refactoring will extend support to include Vietnamese as a base language and systematically replace all hardcoded text with proper i18n strings that follow the user's language settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Vietnamese user, I want the application to be available in Vietnamese so that I can use KiraPilot in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects Vietnamese as their language THEN the system SHALL display all UI elements in Vietnamese
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL support Vietnamese as a valid language option in settings
3. WHEN Vietnamese translations are missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to English translations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text in the application to respect my language settings so that I have a consistent multilingual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change my language preference THEN all UI components SHALL immediately reflect the new language
2. WHEN I interact with any part of the application THEN all visible text SHALL be displayed in my selected language
3. WHEN hardcoded text exists THEN the system SHALL replace it with proper i18n translation keys
4. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the system SHALL log warnings and fallback to English

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI interactions and responses to respect my language settings so that the AI assistant communicates with me in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with the AI assistant THEN all AI interface elements SHALL be displayed in my selected language
2. WHEN the AI provides suggestions or responses THEN system-generated messages SHALL use my selected language
3. WHEN AI tools are executed THEN tool descriptions and feedback SHALL be localized to my language
4. WHEN AI errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be displayed in my selected language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of all hardcoded text so that I can ensure complete i18n coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning UI components THEN the system SHALL identify all hardcoded text strings that need translation
2. WHEN scanning service layers THEN the system SHALL identify user-facing messages that need localization
3. WHEN scanning AI-related code THEN the system SHALL identify all user-facing strings that need translation
4. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive list of strings requiring translation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent translation key naming and organization so that the i18n system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation keys are created THEN they SHALL follow a consistent hierarchical naming convention
2. WHEN new features are added THEN translation keys SHALL be organized by feature domain
3. WHEN translation files are updated THEN all supported languages SHALL maintain the same key structure
4. WHEN keys are missing in non-English languages THEN the system SHALL clearly identify gaps for translators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language support system to handle edge cases gracefully so that the application remains stable regardless of language configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid language is selected THEN the system SHALL fallback to English and log the issue
2. WHEN translation files are corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with fallback translations
3. WHEN dynamic content needs translation THEN the system SHALL handle pluralization and variable substitution correctly
4. WHEN the user switches languages THEN the system SHALL update all components without requiring a restart
