# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive logging capabilities for AI interactions within KiraPilot, allowing users to track, review, and debug all AI conversations and LLM calls. The logging system will capture detailed information about prompts, responses, and system interactions while providing users with full control over data collection and privacy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using KiraPilot, I want to see detailed logs of all AI interactions, so that I can debug issues and understand how the AI is processing my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL log the complete prompt sent to the LLM
2. WHEN an AI response is received THEN the system SHALL log the full response with metadata
3. WHEN tool calls are made during AI interactions THEN the system SHALL log all tool executions and results
4. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL capture timestamps, model information, and session context
5. WHEN multiple AI services are used (Local AI, Gemini) THEN the system SHALL log interactions from all services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a KiraPilot user, I want to view AI interaction logs through the Settings interface, so that I can review past conversations and troubleshoot problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to Settings THEN I SHALL see an "AI Interaction Logs" section
2. WHEN I open the logs section THEN I SHALL see a chronological list of all logged interactions
3. WHEN I select a log entry THEN I SHALL see detailed information including prompt, response, and metadata
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN I SHALL be able to filter by date range, AI service, or interaction type
5. WHEN logs become numerous THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or virtual scrolling for performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want to control AI interaction logging, so that I can disable it when I don't want my conversations stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access Settings THEN I SHALL see a toggle to enable/disable AI interaction logging
2. WHEN logging is disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT store any AI interaction data
3. WHEN I disable logging THEN existing logs SHALL remain until manually cleared
4. WHEN logging is enabled THEN I SHALL see a clear indication of what data is being collected
5. IF logging is disabled by default THEN users SHALL be prompted to enable it on first AI interaction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing storage space, I want to control log retention and cleanup, so that logs don't consume excessive disk space over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access log settings THEN I SHALL see options to configure log retention period
2. WHEN logs exceed the retention period THEN the system SHALL automatically delete old entries
3. WHEN I want to clear logs manually THEN I SHALL have a "Clear All Logs" option with confirmation
4. WHEN logs are cleared THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of the deletion
5. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL warn users before logs consume significant space

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging AI behavior, I want to export log data, so that I can analyze interactions outside the application or share them for support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to export logs THEN I SHALL have an "Export Logs" button in the Settings
2. WHEN exporting logs THEN I SHALL be able to select date ranges and specific AI services
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL save logs in a structured format (JSON or CSV)
4. WHEN exporting sensitive data THEN the system SHALL warn users about privacy implications
5. WHEN export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user experiencing AI issues, I want to see real-time logging status, so that I know when interactions are being captured for debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI logging is active THEN I SHALL see a subtle indicator in the AI chat interface
2. WHEN an interaction is being logged THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
3. WHEN logging fails THEN I SHALL see an error notification with troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN logs are successfully saved THEN the system SHALL confirm the action unobtrusively
5. IF logging is disabled THEN the AI interface SHALL indicate that interactions are not being recorded
