# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a new "Kira" view to the KiraPilot application that provides a dedicated chat interface with thread management capabilities. The Kira view will serve as the primary interface for AI interactions, replacing the current floating chat UI with a full-screen experience that supports organized conversations through threads. Users can create general threads for task management or assign threads to specific tasks/days for contextual assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a dedicated "Kira" chat view from the main navigation, so that I can have focused AI conversations without the limitations of a floating window.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a "Kira" navigation button in the header THEN the application SHALL navigate to the Kira chat view
2. WHEN the Kira view is active THEN the navigation button SHALL be highlighted to indicate the current view
3. WHEN the user is in the Kira view THEN they SHALL see a full-screen chat interface similar to ChatGPT's layout
4. WHEN the user switches away from the Kira view THEN the chat state SHALL be preserved for when they return

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my AI conversations into threads, so that I can maintain context and easily find previous discussions on specific topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Kira view THEN they SHALL see a sidebar with a list of conversation threads

4. WHEN the user clicks on a thread in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL load and display that thread's conversation history
5. WHEN a thread is active THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted in the sidebar
6. WHEN the user deletes a thread THEN the system SHALL remove it from the sidebar and database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to assign threads to specific tasks or days, so that I can get contextual AI assistance related to my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a thread is assigned to a task THEN the AI SHALL have access to that task's context (title, description, status, etc.)
3. WHEN a thread is assigned to a day THEN the AI SHALL have access to that day's tasks and schedule
4. WHEN viewing an assigned thread THEN the sidebar SHALL display the assignment (task name or date)
5. WHEN the user changes a thread's assignment THEN the AI context SHALL be updated accordingly
6. WHEN a thread is unassigned THEN it SHALL function as a general conversation thread

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Kira chat interface to have a consistent design with the rest of the application, so that the experience feels integrated and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Kira view is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same color scheme and typography as other views
2. WHEN displaying messages THEN they SHALL use HeroUI components for consistency

6. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN they SHALL follow the application's button and input styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reuse existing chat functionality in the new Kira view, so that I maintain access to all current AI features like tool execution and feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending messages in the Kira view THEN the system SHALL use the existing AI context and service infrastructure
2. WHEN the AI executes tools THEN the results SHALL be displayed using existing components like ContextualActionButtons
3. WHEN conversations include reasoning or tool executions THEN they SHALL be displayed using existing formatting components

5. WHEN viewing interaction details THEN the system SHALL reuse existing modal components
6. WHEN the AI suggests actions THEN they SHALL be displayed using existing suggestion components

### Requirement 6
