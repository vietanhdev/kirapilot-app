# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Local LLM service in KiraPilot can chat with users but cannot properly execute tool calls. The current implementation has placeholder/mock tool execution instead of calling the actual tool functions defined in `tools.ts`. This prevents users from performing actual task management operations (creating tasks, starting timers, etc.) when using the local model. We need to fix the tool execution system and ensure it works correctly with comprehensive testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user using the Local LLM, I want to be able to create, update, and manage tasks through natural language commands, so that I can be productive without needing an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask the Local LLM to create a task THEN the system SHALL create an actual task in the database
2. WHEN I ask the Local LLM to update a task THEN the system SHALL modify the existing task in the database
3. WHEN I ask the Local LLM to list my tasks THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display actual tasks from the database
4. WHEN I ask the Local LLM to delete a task THEN the system SHALL remove the task from the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user using the Local LLM, I want to be able to start and stop timers for tasks through natural language commands, so that I can track my time accurately while working offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask the Local LLM to start a timer for a task THEN the system SHALL create an active timer session in the database
2. WHEN I ask the Local LLM to stop the current timer THEN the system SHALL end the active session and record the duration
3. WHEN I ask the Local LLM about my current timer status THEN the system SHALL show accurate information about any active sessions
4. WHEN I ask the Local LLM for time tracking data THEN the system SHALL retrieve actual session data from the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user using the Local LLM, I want the tool execution to be properly validated and secured, so that I can trust the AI assistant to only perform authorized actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Local LLM attempts to execute a tool THEN the system SHALL validate permissions before execution
2. WHEN a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
3. WHEN a tool requires confirmation THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for auto-approval
4. IF a tool execution encounters an error THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the Local LLM tool execution system, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tool execution scenarios SHALL be covered with unit tests
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the Local LLM SHALL successfully execute real tool calls end-to-end
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle all failure modes gracefully
4. WHEN testing tool call parsing THEN all supported tool call formats SHALL be correctly parsed and executed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Local LLM to provide clear feedback about tool execution results, so that I understand what actions were performed and their outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool executes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation messages
2. WHEN a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL explain what went wrong and suggest solutions
3. WHEN multiple tools are executed THEN the system SHALL provide feedback for each action
4. WHEN tool results are formatted THEN they SHALL be user-friendly and informative
