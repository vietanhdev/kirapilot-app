# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds local AI model support to KiraPilot using llama-cpp-rs, allowing users to run AI inference locally without requiring internet connectivity or external API calls. The implementation will integrate the unsloth/gemma-3-270m-it-GGUF model (gemma-3-270m-it-Q4_K_M.gguf) and provide users with the ability to choose between local and cloud-based (Gemini) AI models through the settings interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want to use a local AI model for task assistance, so that my data never leaves my device and I can work offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects local model in settings THEN the system SHALL use llama-cpp-rs for AI inference
2. WHEN using local model THEN the system SHALL NOT make any external API calls for AI functionality
3. WHEN the local model is active THEN all AI features SHALL work offline without internet connectivity
4. WHEN the local model processes requests THEN response quality SHALL be appropriate for task management assistance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between local and cloud AI models in settings, so that I can balance between privacy/offline capability and performance based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens AI settings THEN the system SHALL display options for "Local Model" and "Gemini API"
2. WHEN the user selects a model type THEN the system SHALL save this preference persistently
3. WHEN the user switches model types THEN the change SHALL take effect immediately without requiring app restart
4. WHEN no model is configured THEN the system SHALL default to Gemini API with appropriate fallback messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the local model to automatically download and set up when first selected, so that I don't need to manually manage model files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first selects local model THEN the system SHALL automatically download the gemma-3-270m-it-Q4_K_M.gguf model from Hugging Face
2. WHEN downloading the model THEN the system SHALL show download progress to the user
3. WHEN the model download fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fall back to Gemini API
4. WHEN the model is successfully downloaded THEN the system SHALL cache it locally for future use
5. WHEN the model is already cached THEN the system SHALL use the local copy without re-downloading

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the local model to integrate seamlessly with existing AI features, so that I get consistent functionality regardless of which model I choose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using local model THEN all existing AI chat functionality SHALL work identically to Gemini API
2. WHEN using local model THEN tool execution (task creation, modification, etc.) SHALL work without changes
3. WHEN using local model THEN response formatting and markdown rendering SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN switching between models THEN conversation history SHALL be preserved and accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about model status and performance, so that I understand which model is active and how it's performing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is active THEN the AI interface SHALL display which model is currently being used
2. WHEN the local model is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. WHEN the local model encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
4. WHEN the local model is processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
5. WHEN model performance is slow THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about processing time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the local model implementation to be maintainable and extensible, so that additional models can be added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing local model support THEN the code SHALL use a service abstraction pattern
2. WHEN adding the llama-cpp integration THEN it SHALL be isolated in dedicated service modules
3. WHEN the model interface is defined THEN it SHALL support adding different model types in the future
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL provide detailed logging for debugging
5. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN it SHALL include comprehensive unit tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the local model to have reasonable resource usage, so that it doesn't significantly impact my system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local model is running THEN it SHALL use configurable thread limits
2. WHEN the system has limited resources THEN the model SHALL gracefully reduce resource usage
3. WHEN the model is idle THEN it SHALL release unnecessary memory and CPU resources
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL queue them appropriately to prevent resource exhaustion
5. WHEN the model encounters resource constraints THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback to the user
