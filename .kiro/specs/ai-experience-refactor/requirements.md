# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refactors the AI experience in KiraPilot to create a more human-like, user-friendly assistant that focuses on Gemini integration while simplifying interactions and enhancing user engagement. The refactor aims to transform the AI from a technical tool into a supportive companion that understands user emotions, provides contextual assistance, and makes task management more intuitive through natural interactions.

2. WHEN user expresses stress or frustration THEN AI SHALL offer supportive responses and productivity tips
3. WHEN user completes significant tasks THEN AI SHALL provide encouraging feedback and celebration
4. WHEN user seems overwhelmed THEN AI SHALL suggest break times or task prioritization
5. WHEN user interacts with AI THEN system SHALL use warm, conversational language rather than technical responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI experience to be engaging and interesting, so that using the productivity app feels enjoyable rather than mechanical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI provides responses THEN system SHALL use varied, personality-rich language

2. WHEN AI wants to delete or archive items THEN system SHALL require explicit user approval
3. WHEN AI performs bulk operations THEN system SHALL display summary and ask for confirmation
4. WHEN user confirms actions THEN system SHALL provide clear feedback about what was completed
5. IF user cancels an action THEN system SHALL explain what was prevented and offer alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI system architecture to be simplified and maintainable, so that future enhancements can be implemented efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring AI components THEN system SHALL remove unused local model infrastructure
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN system SHALL use consistent patterns for user interaction
3. WHEN AI tools are executed THEN system SHALL follow standardized logging and error handling
4. WHEN user preferences are stored THEN system SHALL use centralized configuration management
5. WHEN AI responses are generated THEN system SHALL use modular, testable components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand context from my task history and patterns, so that it can provide more relevant and personalized assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analyzes user behavior THEN system SHALL identify productivity patterns and preferences
2. WHEN user asks for suggestions THEN AI SHALL consider historical task completion times and success rates
3. WHEN AI recommends scheduling THEN system SHALL factor in user's peak productivity hours
4. WHEN user struggles with tasks THEN AI SHALL offer insights based on similar past experiences
